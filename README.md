# Pentest and red team tools

**DISCALIMER**: All example usage scenarios are a work of fiction. Nonetheless, they are likely to occur in the real world.

1. [ip_spoof.py](./ip_spoof.py) - ARP Poisoning script which poisons a single victim so that other hosts can still communicate with the machine we spoof the address of, thus arousing less suspicion.
    - **Usage**: `sudo python3 ip_spoof.py <victim-ip> <spoofed-ip> <interface>`
      - victim-ip - the ip of the host to poison
      - spoofed-ip - the ip we want to spoof
      - interface - the network interface to use
    - ***Example usage scenario***: An IT-department has deployed a simple FTP server for distribution of updates. The FTP server is located at **10.0.2.5**. A script on other servers and employee workstations is set up to periodically connect to the FTP server and check for updates. The red team has identified a high-value-target server and would like to gain remote access to it. The HVT server is at **10.0.2.42**. As the workstations are running an enterprise anti-virus solution, the red team doesn't want the malicious update to end up on them, since there is a chance it will get detected and blow their covert operation. They set up an FTP honeypot which accepts any kind of authentication and serves a modified update file, which was captured earlier(e.g. using Wireshark). The red team are hiding in a supply closet and are connected over ethernet, using interface **eth0**. They run the command

      `sudo python3 ip_spoof.py 10.0.2.42 10.0.2.5 eth0`
      
      and wait for results.
